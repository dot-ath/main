# Explorers Club

Welcome to your next adventure!

## Concept

Imagine Explorers Club as the game [Destiny](https://www.google.com/search?q=destiny+2+map), but instead planets of, imagine islandsâ€”and each island is a different board, card, drawing, or other quick to learn games. Friends play together in a party from their phones, laptops, and/or TVs via Chromecast.

## Development

Run the web app with `nx run web:serve`.

## Core Stack and Patterns

- supabase / postgres for database
- supabase real-time for syncing game state
- react-three-fiber for 3D graphics
- styled-components for styling
- xstate for state management + actor pattern for sharing distributed real-time state
- static site hosting on netlify
- game server hosting on fly.io
- nx for managing the monorepo
- github actions for CI
