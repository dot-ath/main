## What is Explorers Club?

Imagine Mario Party, but in a browser, set in an archipelagos in the Pacific ocean, with coconut-inspired characters. Players can play together straight from their phones and TVs, and join using a 4-digit code.

Other inspiration we are drawing from: [Rocket Crab](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab), Destiny, BoardGameArena, Tabletop Simulator, Jackbox.TV

## Development

Run the web app with `nx run web:serve`.

## Philosophy

We are wondering‚Äîwhy aren't there more good open-source games? Why is the code for most of the games we play locked and hidden within private repositories that nobody can see and improve?

We believe that this doesn't have to be the case. We believe that many of the games we play in the future will be created by emergent and excited open-source communities‚Äîlike the one we aim to create around Explorers Club.
